# 🌾 Agricultural Data Analysis & Visualization (Karnataka)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on agricultural data from **Karnataka, India**.

The notebook explores how different crops, seasons, cultivated area, and production levels are related.  
By using data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to discover patterns and trends in agricultural production.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main goals of this analysis are:

- To understand the structure and content of the agricultural dataset
- To analyze crop production across different seasons
- To explore relationships between cultivated area and production
- To visualize important patterns using simple graphs
- To summarize insights in an easy-to-understand way


## 📦 Importing Required Libraries

In this section, we import the Python libraries needed for data analysis and visualization.

- **Pandas** is used for loading and manipulating datasets
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are used for creating visualizations


import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
