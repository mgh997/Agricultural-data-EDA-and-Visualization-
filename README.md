# 🌾 Agricultural Data EDA & Visualization

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of agricultural data from Karnataka, India**. The goal is to understand how different factors such as crop type, season, area cultivated, and production levels interact and influence agricultural outcomes.

The repository is designed as a **data analysis portfolio project**, demonstrating data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and interpretation skills using Python.

## 🎯 Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

* To explore and understand agricultural production patterns in Karnataka
* To identify trends across crops, seasons, and years
* To visualize relationships between cultivated area and crop production
* To derive meaningful insights that could help researchers, students, and policymakers

## 📂 Dataset Description

* **File name:** `karnataka.csv`
* **Region:** Karnataka, India
* **Content:** Crop production data
* **Key columns include:**

  * `Crop`: Type of crop
  * `Season`: Agricultural season
  * `Area`: Area cultivated
  * `Production`: Crop production amount

The dataset is included directly in this repository for ease of reproducibility.

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Certain crops dominate agricultural production across multiple seasons
* Production volume does not always increase proportionally with cultivated area
* Seasonal patterns play a significant role in crop yield variations

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Apply predictive models to estimate crop production
* Build an interactive dashboard using Plotly or Power BI
* Compare agricultural trends across different Indian states
