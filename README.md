# Agricultural Data EDA & Visualization

## Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of agricultural data from Karnataka, India**. The goal is to understand how different factors such as crop type, season, area cultivated, and production levels interact and influence agricultural outcomes.

The repository is designed as a **data analysis portfolio project**, demonstrating data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and interpretation skills using Python.

---

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

* To explore and understand agricultural production patterns in Karnataka
* To identify trends across crops, seasons, and years
* To visualize relationships between cultivated area and crop production
* To derive meaningful insights that could help researchers, students, and policymakers

---

## Dataset Description

* **File name:** `karnataka.csv`
* **Region:** Karnataka, India
* **Content:** Crop production data
* **Key columns include:**

  * `Crop`: Type of crop
  * `Season`: Agricultural season
  * `Area`: Area cultivated

The dataset is included directly in this repository for ease of reproducibility.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights

Some of the main analysis steps performed include:

* Checking dataset structure and summary statistics
* Handling missing or inconsistent values
* Exploring crop distribution across seasons
* Analyzing production and cultivated area trends
* Visualizing relationships using bar charts, line plots, and distribution plots

## Key Insights

* Certain crops dominate agricultural production across multiple seasons
* Production volume does not always increase proportionally with cultivated area
* Seasonal patterns play a significant role in crop yield variations
